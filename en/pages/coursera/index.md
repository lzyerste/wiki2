### [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)

**Master Algorithmic Programming Techniques**

Learn algorithms through programming and advance your software engineering or data science career

**Creator: UC San Diego**

**About This Specialization**

The Specialization covers algorithmic techniques for solving problems arising in computer science applications. It is a mix of theory and practice: you will not only design algorithms and estimate their complexity, but you will get a deeper understanding of algorithms by implementing them in the programming **language of your choice** (C, C++, C#, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Python2, Python3, Ruby, and Scala).

This Specialization is unique, because it offers **two real-world projects**. **Advanced Shortest Paths project** is offered in the end of the Algorithms on Graphs course. In this project, you'll deal with road network analysis and social network analysis. You'll learn how to compute the fastest route between New York and Mountain View thousands of times faster than classic algorithms and close to those used in Google Maps. Through **Genome Assembly culminating project** at the end of the Specialization, you'll learn how to assemble genomes from millions of short pieces and how algorithms fuel recent developments in personalized medicine.

#### 1. [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox)

已下载。

**About the Course**

The course covers **basic algorithmic** techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: **sorting** and **searching**, **divide and conquer**, **greedy algorithms**, **dynamic programming**. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).

#### 2. [Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures)

已下载。

**About the Course**

A good algorithm usually comes together with a set of good data structures that allow the algorithm to manipulate the data efficiently. In this course, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. You will learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments. This will help you to understand what is going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect from it. You will also learn typical use cases for these data structures.

A few examples of questions that we are going to cover in this class are the following: 

1. What is a good strategy of resizing a **dynamic array**? 
2. How **priority queues** are implemented in C++, Java, and Python? 
3. How to implement a **hash table** so that the amortized running time of all operations is O(1) on average? 
4. What are good strategies to keep a **binary tree** balanced? 

You will also learn how services like Dropbox manage to upload some large files instantly and to save a lot of storage space!

#### 3. [Algorithms on Graphs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs)

已下载。

**About the Course**

If you have ever used a navigation service to find optimal route and estimate time to destination, you've used algorithms on graphs. Graphs arise in various real-world situations as there are **road networks**, **computer networks** and, most recently, **social networks**! If you're looking for the fastest time to get to work, cheapest way to connect set of computers into a network or efficient algorithm to automatically find communities and opinion leaders in Facebook, you're going to work with graphs and algorithms on graphs.

In this course, you will first learn what a graph is and what are some of the most important properties. Then you'll learn several ways to **traverse graphs** and how you can do useful things while traversing the graph in some order. We will then talk about **shortest paths algorithms** — from the basic ones to those which open door for 1000000 times faster algorithms used in **Google Maps** and other navigational services. You will use these algorithms if you choose to work on our **Fast Shortest Routes industrial capstone project**. We will finish with minimum **spanning trees** which are used to plan road, telephone and computer networks and also find applications in clustering and approximate algorithms.

#### 4. [Algorithms on Strings](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-strings)

已下载。

**About the Course**

World and internet is full of textual information. We search for information using textual queries, we read websites, books, e-mails. All those are strings from the point of view of computer science. To make sense of all that information and make search efficient, search engines use many string algorithms. Moreover, the emerging field of personalized medicine uses many search algorithms to find disease-causing mutations in the human genome.

#### 5. [Advanced Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-algorithms-and-complexity)

已下载。

**About the Course**

You've learned the basic algorithms now and are ready to step into the area of more complex problems and algorithms to solve them. Advanced algorithms build upon basic ones and use new ideas. We will start with **networks flows** which are used in more typical applications such as optimal matchings, finding disjoint paths and flight scheduling as well as more surprising ones like image segmentation in computer vision. We then proceed to **linear programming** with applications in optimizing budget allocation, portfolio optimization, finding the cheapest diet satisfying all requirements and many others. Next we discuss inherently hard problems for which no exact good solutions are known (and not likely to be found) and how to solve them in practice. We finish with a soft introduction to **streaming algorithms** that are heavily used in **Big Data processing**. Such algorithms are usually designed to be able to process huge datasets without being able even to store a dataset.

#### 6. [Genome Assembly Programming Challenge](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assembling-genomes)

必须完成前置课程。

**About the Capstone Project**

In Spring 2011, thousands of people in Germany were hospitalized with a deadly disease that started as food poisoning with bloody diarrhea and often led to kidney failure. It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Soon, German officials linked the outbreak to a restaurant in Lübeck, where nearly 20% of the patrons had developed bloody diarrhea in a single week. At this point, biologists knew that they were facing a previously unknown pathogen and that traditional methods would not suffice – computational biologists would be needed to assemble and analyze the genome of the newly emerged pathogen.

To investigate the evolutionary origin and pathogenic potential of the outbreak strain, researchers started a crowdsourced research program. They released bacterial DNA sequencing data from one of a patient, which elicited a burst of analyses carried out by computational biologists on four continents. They even used GitHub for the project: https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wiki

The 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak. In this Genome Assembly Programming Challenge, you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the outbreak by developing a program to assemble the genome of the E. coli X from millions of overlapping substrings of the E.coli X genome.

#### [Online Games: Literature, New Media, and Narrative](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-media-gaming)

About this course: Intended for both newcomers who are curious about video games and experienced gamers who want to reflect on their passion, this course will explore what happens to stories, paintings, and films when they become the basis of massively multiplayer online games.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy—the novels, films, and video game—are our central example of how “remediation” transforms familiar stories as they move across media. 

The course is designed as a university-level English literature class—a multi-genre, multimedia tour of how literature, film, and games engage in the basic human activity of storytelling.  Our journey will enable us to learn something about narrative theory, introduce us to some key topics in media studies and cover some of the history and theory of video games.  It will also take us to some landmarks of romance literature, the neverending story that lies behind most fantasy games: J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring, a bit of Edmund Spenser’s Faerie Queene, and poems by Keats, Tennyson, Browning, and others.

Drawing on centuries of romance narrative conventions, the twenty-first century gaming industry has become a creative and economic powerhouse.  It engages the talents of some of our brightest writers, artists, composers, computer engineers, game theorists, video producers, and marketing professionals, and in 2012, it generated an estimated $64 billion in revenue.  Anyone interested in today’s culture needs to be conversant with the ways this new medium is altering our understanding of stories.  Join me as we set out on an intellectual adventure, the quest to discover the cultural heritage of online games.

**About the Course**

Welcome to Course One of Photography Basics and Beyond: From Smartphone to DSLR! In these first 4 Modules you will gain the knowledge and the confidence that will help you make good choices as you consider qualities of the camera you own, and the qualities of the other types of digital cameras you might be considering. You will learn about the basic functions that most digital cameras have in common.  You will also go beyond the "technical" matters and learn about how you can make exciting pictures by emphasizing the aspects of Frame and Vantage Point to interpret old subjects in new ways.  Discovering accessories that photographers find useful, and the types of camera bags from mini to carry-on sized, is also in store for you.  You will also make your first photographs and, if you are a subscriber to the specialization, upload pictures to the web gallery and start interacting with your fellow learners in our "Gallery."  Let's get started with Module One!

About the Course

Welcome to Course Two of Photography Basics and Beyond: From Smartphone to DSLR!  Now that you have a broad understanding of the various types of cameras, the importance of setting up Menus and Functions to gain control in your photography, and the difference between Auto and Program exposure modes, you are ready to move into even greater Camera Control!  In these 4 Modules we will concentrate on gaining the knowledge necessary to make use of Exposure Modes, Light Metering, Effects of various ISO settings, Lens options, using Shutter Speeds to convey aspects of Time in both documentary and creative ways, and exploring the controlled focus effects that Depth of Field Principles make possible.   You will also continue to make new photographs and, if you are a subscriber to the specialization, continue interacting with your fellow learners as you share photographs for Peer Review.  You will also confirm your knowledge through completion of quizzes and written responses.  Let's get started with Module One!

#### 3. [Principles of Photo Composition and Digital Image Post-Production](https://www.coursera.org/learn/photo-composition)

已下载。

About the Course

Welcome to Course THREE!  In the first two Modules you will gain a more professional-level understanding of the Design Elements that artists have used throughout history to create successful compositions.  Arranging the Elements in ways that lead viewers through their compositions is an essential craft for photographers no matter whether their subject matter is pure documentary or vividly exotic personal expression.  In Modules 3 & 4 we survey the essential elements of post-photography image management, using Adobe(tm) LIGHTROOM(tm).  Image adjustment software designed for Smartphone photographers rounds out the Course.  Since even photographers whose mainstay is a high-end DSLR also must admit to Smartphone use occasionally, and photographers who only use a Smartphone will usually admit that they want to step over to a "regular" camera at some point, there is something for everyone here!  Let's get started with Module One!

#### 4. [Photography Techniques: Light, Content, and Sharing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/photography-techniques)

已下载。

About the Course

Welcome to Course FOUR!   In Modules 1-4 you will cover the final elements of the Specialization necessary to round out this introduction to the fundamentals of Photography, and prepare you for creating your own exciting project in the Capstone!  You have come a long way since the beginning of this journey from Smartphone Basics to DSLR and Beyond.  Just think of all the information you have absorbed and put to use in your assignments and quizzes, and the confidence you have gained that you CAN control the camera to make pictures you are proud to share. 

Here in Course Four you will start by gaining knowledge related to content in photography, from fact to fiction, documentary to purely expressive.  Next you will learn principles, tips, and techniques for using the essential element of Light in Ambient/Natural settings.

The flash/strobe unit, whether it is built-in to your camera or an add-on "hotshoe" model, will finally be something you, not the camera, controls!  You will prove to yourself that those former mysteries of Controlled Continuous and Strobe lighting will no longer be mysterious, as you apply your knowledge to creation of assignment photographs in various situations.  Sharing those pictures in Peer Review will give you the opportunity to learn from your fellow photographers' solutions to lighting challenges, and to gain insight into your own work and creative approaches too.

There is an important word to share about Peer Review assignments for this course.  As photographers who have accomplished the quiz and photography requirements of Courses One through Three, you have the knowledge and capability to create quality photographs at a much higher rate of success, and in a much shorter time, than when you began.  You have also proven that you are a dedicated Learner, someone who has a passion for photography and is willing to put forth the extra effort necessary to accomplish your goals.  This Course is the last before the Capstone Course, in which you will be tasked with creating a project over a 2-month period of dedicated photography.  The Peer Review photography assignments have been structured with both your advanced capabilities and dedication in mind...in other words, they will require both!  Be prepared to allocate more time than you have in previous Courses for the assignments, because they will take more time and because you will really enjoy them!

Course Four ends with an overview of methods for finalizing your pictures in print form, including simple but effective matting techniques, and in web page designs as well.  The pleasures and perils of sharing in social media sites are also yours to discover.  Protecting your copyrights by understanding that concept and the ways that you can assert them, being careful about blogs and other outlets, and recognizing you are part of a community that respects the individual's creative effort, well that is  important knowledge to have in preparation for the Capstone too!  Let's get started with Module One!

#### 5. [Photography Capstone Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/photography-project)

需要完成前置课程。

**About the Capstone Project**

The Capstone Project is your opportunity to take advantage of the knowledge you have gained through our journey in learning about photography, to develop a meaningful project of 10 well formed photographs based in your passion for artistic expression, or a subject for documentary exploration, insightful portraiture, imaging for work-related subjects, or some other aspect of photography.  We are confident that it will be a project that you will be excited to share with fellow Learners, and with Professors Peter Glendinning and Mark Sullivan too!  A unique feature of this Course is the individual review and responsive input you will receive directly from Peter or Mark, who will be viewing your pictures and making evaluations of all projects at the end of the Capstone.  You should plan on spending more time on this Course per week than any other in this Specialization, and much of it will be in making photographs.

During the entire period of development, you and your fellow learners will be supporting each other as you work independently, by sharing your work-in-progress from the initial Project Plan to the final Portfolio.  At each stage, all Learners will share comments and suggestions with each other, helping each other to gauge progress and to learn about different approaches to photography and content.  By expressing your own ideas and expectations about quality in response to the work of others, you will be forming your own criteria of excellence as well.  

Along the way there will be multiple opportunities for sharing pictures and ideas through carefully designed Peer Review.  This sharing of photographs and comments with peers, and reflecting on their comments about your photos, will be an exciting learning experience that will help you grow in understanding your own photography and that of others.  Your contribution of comments to fellow Learners will not only help them understand their photographs better, but it will give you an opportunity to use the vocabulary of terms that are related to techniques, design principles, and content approaches that you have learned through your success in each of the previous Modules.  

A unique aspect of this Specialization is that everyone who completes the requirements  will receive, in addition to their Certificate of Specialization from Michigan State University, access to substantial discounts on equipment, accessories, and membership benefits through Industry Partners from among the premier manufacturers of photography equipment and related items:  Fracture, Gary Fong, Gyst, Lensbaby, LensPen, Lume Cube Lighting, Photo District News, PhotoVideoEdu, Think Tank Cases/Bags.
