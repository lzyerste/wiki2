## 第一篇：Youth 青春

by Samuel Ullman

Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.

Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity of the appetite, for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in a man of sixty more than a boy of twenty. Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals.

Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust.

Whether sixty or sixteen, there is in every human being’s heart the lure of wonder, the unfailing child-like appetite of what’s next, and the joy of the game of living. In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless station; so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer, courage and power from men and from the Infinite, so long are you young.

When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism, then you are grown old, even at twenty, but as long as your aerials are up, to catch the waves of optimism, there is hope you may die young at eighty.

## 第二篇： Three Days to See(Excerpts)假如给我三天光明（节选）

by Hellen Keller

All of us have read thrilling stories in which the hero had only a limited and specified time to live. Sometimes it was as long as a year; sometimes as short as twenty-four hours. But always we were interested in discovering just how the doomed man chose to spend his last days or his last hours. I speak, of course, of free men who have a choice, not condemned criminals whose sphere of activities is strictly delimited.

Such stories set us thinking, wondering what we should do under similar circumstances. What events, what experiences, what associations, should we crowd into those last hours as mortal beings? What happiness should we find in reviewing the past, what regrets?

Sometimes I have thought it would be an excellent rule to live each day as if we should die tomorrow. Such an attitude would emphasize sharply the values of life. We should live each day with a gentleness, a vigor, and a keenness of appreciation which are often lost when time stretches before us in the constant panorama of more days and months and years to come. There are those, of course, who would adopt the epicurean motto of 'Eat, drink, and be merry,' but most people would be chastened by the certainty of impending death.
Discuss this article in the Arts & Literature forum of Post & Riposte. 
In stories, the doomed hero is usually saved at the last minute by some stroke of fortune, but almost always his sense of values is changed. He becomes more appreciative of the meaning of life and its permanent spiritual values. It has often been noted that those who live, or have lived, in the shadow of death bring a mellow sweetness to everything they do.

Most of us, however, take life for granted. We know that one day we must die, but usually we picture that day as far in the future. When we are in buoyant health, death is all but unimaginable. We seldom think of it. The days stretch out in an endless vista. So we go about our petty tasks, hardly aware of our listless attitude toward life.

The same lethargy, I am afraid, characterizes the use of all our faculties and senses. Only the deaf appreciate hearing, only the blind realize the manifold blessings that lie in sight. Particularly does this observation apply to those who have lost sight and hearing in adult life. But those who have never suffered impairment of sight or hearing seldom make the fullest use of these blessed faculties. Their eyes and ears take in all sights and sounds hazily, without concentration and with little appreciation. It is the same old story of not being grateful for what we have until we lose it, of not being conscious of health until we are ill.

I have often thought it would be a blessing if each human being were stricken blind and deaf for a few days at some time during his early adult life. Darkness would make him more appreciative of sight; silence would teach him the joys of sound.

## 第三篇：Companionship of Books 以书为伴（节选）

by Samuel Smiles

A man may usually be known by the books he reads as well as by the company he keeps; for there is a companionship of books as well as of men; and one should always live in the best company, whether it be of books or of men.

A good book may be among the best of friends. It is the same today that it always was, and it will never change. It is the most patient and cheerful of companions. It does not turn its back upon us in times of adversity or distress. It always receives us with the same kindness; amusing and instructing us in youth, and comforting and consoling us in age.

Men often discover their affinity to each other by the mutual love they have for a book just as two persons sometimes discover a friend by the admiration which both entertain for a third. There is an old proverb, ‘Love me, love my dog.” But there is more wisdom in this:” Love me,love my book.” The book is a truer and higher bond of union. Men can think,feel, and sympathize with each other through their favorite author. They live in him together, and he in them.

A good book is often the best urn of a life enshrining the best that life could think out; for the world of a man’s life is, for the most part, but the world of his thoughts. Thus the best books are treasuries of good words, the golden thoughts, which, remembered and cherished, become our constant companions and comforters.

Books possess an essence of immortality. They are by far the most lasting products of human effort. Temples and statues decay, but books survive. Time is of no account with great thoughts, which are as fresh today as when they first passed through their author’s minds, ages ago. What was then said and thought still speaks to us as vividly as ever from the printed page. The only effect of time have been to sift out the bad products;for nothing in literature can long survive e but what is really good.

Books introduce us into the best society; they bring us into the presence of the greatest minds that have ever lived. We hear what they said and did; we see the as if they were really alive; we sympathize with them, enjoy with them, grieve with them; their experience becomes ours, and we feel as if we were in a measure actors with them in the scenes which they describe.

The great and good do not die, even in this world.Embalmed in books, their spirits walk abroad. The book is a living voice. It is an intellect to which on still listens.

## 第四篇：If I Rest,I Rust 如果我休息，我就会生锈

by Orison Swett Marden

The significant inscription found on an old key,--"If I rest, I rust,"--would be an excellent motto for those who are afflicted with the slightest taint of idleness. Even the industrious might adopt it with advantage to serve as a reminder that, if one allows his faculties to rest, like the iron in the unused key, they will soon show signs of rust, and, ultimately, cannot do the work required of them.

Those who would attain the heights by great men reached and kept must keep their faculties burnished by constant use, so that they will unlock the doors of knowledge, the gates that guard the entrances to the professions, to science, art, literature, agriculture,--every department of human endeavor.

Industry keeps bright the key that opens the treasury of achievement. If Hugh Miller, after toiling all day in a quarry, had devoted his evenings to rest and recreation, he would never have become a famous geologist. The celebrated mathematician, Edmund Stone, would never have published a mathematical dictionary, never have found the key to the science of mathematics, if he had given his spare moments, snatched from the duties of a gardener, to idleness. Had the little Scotch lad, Ferguson, allowed the busy brain to go to sleep while he tended sheep on the hillside, instead of calculating the position of the stars by the help of a string of beads, he would never have become a famous astronomer.

Labor vanquishes all--not in constant, spasmodic, or ill-directed labor, but faithful, unremitting, daily effort toward a well-directed purpose. Just as truly as eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, so is eternal industry the price of noble and enduring success.

## 第五篇：Ambition 抱负

It is not difficult to imagine a world short of ambition. It would probably be a kinder world: without demands, without abrasions, without disappointments. People would have time for reflection. Such work as they did would not be for themselves but for the collectivity.Competition would never enter in. conflict would be eliminated, tension become a thing of the past. The stress of creation would be at an end. Art would no longer be troubling, but purely celebratory in its functions. Longevity would be increased, for fewer people would die of heart attack or stroke caused by tumultuous endeavor. Anxiety would be extinct. Time would stretch on and on,with ambition long departed from the human heart.

Ah, how unrelieved boring life would be!

There is a strong view that holds that success is a myth, and ambition therefore a sham. Does this mean that success does not really exist? That achievement is at bottom empty? That the efforts of men and women are of no significance alongside the force of movements and events now not all success, obviously, is worth esteeming, nor all ambition worth cultivating. Which are and which are not is something one soon enough learns on one’s own. But even the most cynical secretly admit that success exists; that achievement counts for a great deal; and that the true myth is that the actions of men and women are useless. To believe otherwise is to take on a point of view that is likely to be deranging. It is, in its implications, to remove all motives for competence, interest in attainment, and regard for posterity.

We do not choose to be born. We do not choose our parents. We do not choose our historical epoch, the country of our birth, or the immediate circumstances of our upbringing. We do not, most of us, choose to die; nor do we choose the time or conditions of our death. But within all this realm of choicelessness, we do choose how we shall live: courageously or in cowardice, honorably or dishonorably, with purpose or in drift. We decide what is important and what is trivial in life. We decide that what makes us significant is either what we do or what we refuse to do. But no matter how indifferent the universe may be to our choices and decisions, these choices and decisions are ours to make. We decide. We choose. And as we decide and choose,so are our lives formed. In the end, forming our own destiny is what ambition is about.

## 第六篇：What I have Lived for 我为何而生

Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds,have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a deep ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.

I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy---ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of my life for a few hours for this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness---that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it, finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saint sand poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what---at last---I have found.

With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved.

Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always it brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.

This has been my life. I have found it worth living,and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.

## 第七篇：When Love Beckons You 爱的召唤

When Love Beckons You

When love beckons to you, follow him, though his ways are hard and steep. And when his wings enfold you, yield to him, though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. And when he speaks to you,believe in him, though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.

For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, so shall he descend to our roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.

But if, in your fear, you would seek only love’s peace and love’s pleasure, then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love’s threshing-floor, into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears. Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. Love possesses not, nor would it be possessed, for love is sufficient unto love.

Love has no other desire but to fulfill itself. But if you love and must have desires, let these be your desires:

To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.

To know the pain of too much tenderness.

To be wounded by your own understanding of love;

And to bleed willingly and joyfully.

To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;

To rest at the noon hour and meditate love’s ecstasy;

To return home at eventide with gratitude;

And then to sleep with a payer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.

## 第八篇：The Road to Success 成功之道

It is well that young men should begin at the beginning and occupy the most subordinate positions. Many of the leading businessmen of Pittsburgh had a serious responsibility thrust upon them at the very threshold of their career. They were introduced to the broom, and spent the first hours of their business lives sweeping out the office. I notice we have janitors and janitresses now in offices, and our young men unfortunately miss that salutary branch of business education. But if by chance the professional sweeper is absent any morning, the boy who has the genius of the future partner in him will not hesitate to try his hand at the broom. It does not hurt the newest comer to sweep out the office if necessary. I was one of those sweepers myself.

Assuming that you have all obtained employment and are fairly started, my advice to you is “aim high”. I would not give a fig for the young man who does not already see himself the partner or the head of an important firm. Do not rest content for a moment in your thoughts as head clerk, or foreman, or general manager in any concern, no matter how extensive.Say to yourself, “My place is at the top.” Be king in your dreams.

And here is the prime condition of success, the great secret: concentrate your energy, thought, and capital exclusively upon the business in which you are engaged. Having begun in one line, resolve to fight it out on that line, to lead in it, adopt every improvement, have the best machinery, and know the most about it.

The concerns which fail are those which have scattered their capital, which means that they have scattered their brains also. They have investments in this, or that, or the other, here there, and everywhere.“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” is all wrong. I tell you to “put all your eggs in one basket, and then watch that basket.” Look round you and take notice, men who do that not often fail. It is easy to watch and carry the one basket. It is trying to carry too many baskets that breaks most eggs in this country. He who carries three baskets must put one on his head, which is apt to tumble and trip him up. One fault of the American businessman is lack of concentration.

To summarize what I have said: aim for the highest;never enter a bar room; do not touch liquor, or if at all only at meals; never speculate; never indorse beyond your surplus cash fund; make the firm's interest yours; break orders always to save owners; concentrate; put all your eggs in one basket, and watch that basket; expenditure always within revenue;lastly, be not impatient, for as Emerson says, “no one can cheat you out of ultimate success but yourselves.”

## 第九篇：On Meeting the Celebrated 论见名人

I have always wondered at the passion many people have to meet the celebrated. The prestige you acquire by being able to tell your friends that you know famous men proves only that you are yourself of small account. The celebrated develop a technique to deal with the persons they come across. They show the world a mask, often an impressive on, but take care to conceal their real selves. They play the part that is expected from them, and with practice learn to play it very well, but you are stupid if you think that this public performance of theirs corresponds with the man within.

I have been attached, deeply attached, to a few people; but I have been interested in men in general not for their own sakes,but for the sake of my work. I have not, as Kant enjoined, regarded each man as an end in himself, but as material that might be useful to me as a writer. I have been more concerned with the obscure than with the famous. They are more often themselves. They have had no need to create a figure to protect themselves from the world or to impress it. Their idiosyncrasies have had more chance to develop in the limited circle of their activity, and since they have never been in the public eye it has never occurred to them that they have anything to conceal. They display their oddities because it has never struck them that they are odd. And after all it is with the common run of men that we writers have to deal; kings, dictators, commercial magnates are from our point of view very unsatisfactory. To write about them is a venture that has often tempted writers, but the failure that has attended their efforts shows that such beings are too exceptional to form a proper ground for a work of art. They cannot be made real. The ordinary is the writer’s richer field. Its unexpectedness, its singularity, its infinite variety afford unending material.The great man is too often all of a piece; it is the little man that is a bundle of contradictory elements. He is inexhaustible. You never come to the end of the surprises he has in store for you. For my part I would much sooner spend a month on a desert island with a veterinary surgeon than with a prime minister.

## 第十篇：The 50-Percent Theory of Life 生活理论半对半

by Steve Porter

I believe in the 50-percent theory. Half the time things are better than normal; the other half, they are worse. I believe life is a pendulum swing. It takes time and experience to understand what normal is, and that gives me the perspective to deal with the surprises of the future.

Let’s benchmark the parameters: Yes, I will die. I’ve dealt with the deaths of both parents, a best friend, a beloved boss and cherished pets. Some of these deaths have been violent, before my eyes, or slow and agonizing. Bad stuff, and it belongs at the bottom of the scale.

Then there are those high points: romance and marriage to the right person; having a child and doing those Dad things like coaching my son’s baseball team, paddling around the creek in the boat while he’s swimming with the dogs, discovering his compassion so deep it manifests even in his kindness to snails, his imagination so vivid he builds a spaceship from a scattered pile of Legos.

But there is a vast meadow of life in the middle, where the bad and the good flip-flop acrobatically. This is what convinces me to believe in the 50-percent theory.

One spring I planted corn too early in a bottomland so flood-prone that neighbors laughed. I felt chagrined at the wasted effort. Summer turned brutal — the worst heat wave and drought in my lifetime. The air-conditioner died, the well went dry, the marriage ended, the job lost, the money gone. I was living lyrics from a country tune — music I loathed. Only a surging Kansas City Royals team, bound for their first World Series, buoyed my spirits.

Looking back on that horrible summer, I soon understood that all succeeding good things merely offset the bad. Worse than normal wouldn’t last long. I am owed and savor the halcyon times. They reinvigorate me for the next nasty surprise and offer assurance that I can thrive. The 50 percent theory even helps me see hope beyond my Royals’ recent slump, a field of struggling rookies sown so that some year soon we can reap an October harvest.

Oh, yeah, the corn crop? For that one blistering summer, the ground moisture was just right, planting early allowed pollination before heat withered the tops, and the lack of rain spared the standing corn from floods. That winter my crib overflowed with corn — fat, healthy three-to-a-stalk ears filled with kernels from heel to tip — while my neighbors’ fields yielded only brown, empty husks.

Although plantings past may have fallen below the 50-percent expectation, and they probably will again in the future, I am still sustained by the crop that flourishes during the drought.

## 第十一篇：What is Your Recovery Rate? 你的恢复速率是多少？ TODO

What is Your Recovery Rate?

What is your recovery rate? How long does it take youto recover from actions and behaviors that upset you? Minutes? Hours? Days?Weeks? The longer it takes you to recover, the more influence that incident hason your actions, and the less able you are to perform to your personal best. Ina nutshell, the longer it takes you to recover, the weaker you are and thepoorer your performance.

You are well aware that you need to exercise to keepthe body fit and, no doubt, accept that a reasonable measure of health is thespeed in which your heart and respiratory system recovers after exercise.Likewise the faster you let go of an issue that upsets you, the faster youreturn to an equilibrium, the healthier you will be. The best example of thisbehavior is found with professional sportspeople. They know that the fasterthey can forget an incident or missd opportunity and get on with the game, thebetter their performance. In fact, most measure the time it takes them toovercome and forget an incident in a game and most reckon a recovery rate of 30seconds is too long!

Imagine yourself to be an actor in a play on thestage. Your aim is to play your part to the best of your ability. You have beengiven a script and at the end of each sentence is a ful stop. Each time you getto the end of the sentence you start a new one and although the next sentenceis related to the last it is not affected by it. Your job is to deliver eachsentence to the best of your ability.

Don’t live your life in the past! Learn to live in thepresent, to overcome the past. Stop the past from influencing your daily life.Don’t allow thoughts of the past to reduce your personal best. Stop the pastfrom interfering with your life. Learn to recover quickly.

Remember: Romewasn’t built in a day. Reflect on your recovery rate each day. Every day beforeyou go to bed, look at your progress. Don’t lie in bed saying to you, “I didthat wrong.” “I should have done better there.” No. look at your day and notewhen you made an effort to place a full stop after an incident. This is asuccess. You are taking control of your life. Remember this is a step by stepprocess. This is not a make-over. You are undertaking real change here. Youraim: reduce the time spent in recovery.

The way forward?

Live in the present. Not in the precedent.

## 第十二篇：Clear Your Mental Space 清理心灵的空间

Clear Your Mental Space

Think about the last time you felt a negativeemotion---like stress, anger, or frustration. What was going through your mindas you were going through that negativity? Was your mind cluttered withthoughts? Or was it paralyzed, unable to think?

The next time you find yourself in the middle of avery stressful time, or you feel angry or frustrated, stop. Yes, that’s right,stop. Whatever you’re doing, stop and sit for one minute. While you’re sittingthere, completely immerse yourself in the negative emotion.

Allow that emotion to consume you. Allow yourself oneminute to truly feel that emotion. Don’t cheat yourself here. Take the entireminute---but only one minute---to do nothing else but feel that emotion.

When the minute is over, ask yourself, “Am I wiling tokeep holding on to this negative emotion as I go through the rest of the day?”

Once you’ve allowed yourself to be totally immersed inthe emotion and really fell it, you will be surprised to find that the emotionclears rather quickly.

If you feel you need to hold on to the emotion for alittle longer, that is OK. Allow yourself another minute to feel the emotion.

When you feel you’ve had enough of the emotion, askyourself if you’re willing to carry that negativity with you for the rest ofthe day. If not, take a deep breath. As you exhale, release all that negativitywith your breath.

This exercise seems simple---almost too simple. But,it is very effective. By allowing that negative emotion the space to be trulyfelt, you are dealing with the emotion rather than stuffing it down and tryingnot to feel it. You are actually taking away the power of the emotion by givingit the space and attention it needs. When you immerse yourself in the emotion,and realize that it is only emotion, it loses its control. You can clear yourhead and proceed with your task.

Try it. Next time you’re in the middle of a negativeemotion, give yourself the space to feel the emotion and see what happens. Keepa piece of paper with you that says the following:

Stop. Immerse for one minute. Do I want to keep thisnegativity? Breath deep, exhale, release. Move on!

This will remind you of the steps to the process.Remember; take the time you need to really immerse yourself in the emotion.Then, when you feel you’ve felt it enough, release it---really let go of it.You will be surprised at how quickly you can move on from a negative situationand get to what you really want to do!

## 第十三篇：Be Happy 快乐

Be Happy!

“The days that make us happymake us wise.”----John Masefield

when I first read this line by England’s Poet Laureate, itstartled me. What did Masefield mean? Without thinking about it much, I hadalways assumed that the opposite was true. But his sober assurance wasarresting. I could not forget it.

Finally, I seemed to grasp his meaning and realizedthat here was a profound observation. The wisdom that happiness makes possiblelies in clear perception, not fogged by anxiety nor dimmed by despair andboredom, and without the blind spots caused by fear.

Active happiness---not mere satisfaction orcontentment ---often comes suddenly, like an April shower or the unfolding of abud. Then you discover what kind of wisdom has accompanied it. The grass isgreener; bird songs are sweeter; the shortcomings of your friends are moreunderstandable and more forgivable. Happiness is like a pair of eyeglassescorrecting your spiritual vision.

Nor are the insights of happiness limited to what isnear around you. Unhappy, with your thoughts turned in upon your emotionalwoes, your vision is cut short as though by a wall. Happy, the wall crumbles.

The long vista is there for the seeing. The ground atyour feet, the world about you----people, thoughts, emotions, pressures---arenow fitted into the larger scene. Everything assumes a fairer proportion. Andhere is the beginning of wisdom.

## 第十四篇：The Goodness of life 生命的美好

The Goodness of Life

Though there is much to be concerned about, there isfar, far more for which to be thankful. Though life’s goodness can at times beovershadowed, it is never outweighed.

For every single act that is senselessly destructive,there are thousands more small, quiet acts of love, kindness and compassion.For every person who seeks to hurt, there are many, many more who devote theirlives to helping and to healing.

There is goodness to life that cannot be denied.

In the most magnificent vistas and in the smallestdetails, look closely, for that goodness always comes shining through.

There si no limit to the goodness of life. It growsmore abundant with each new encounter. The more you experience and appreciatethe goodness of life, the more there is to be lived.

Even when the cold winds blow and the world seems tobe cov ered in foggy shadows, the goodness of life lives on. Open your eyes,open your heart, and you will see that goodness is everywhere.

Though the goodness of life seems at times to suffersetbacks, it always endures. For in the darkest moment it becomes vividly clearthat life is a priceless treasure. And so the goodness of life is made evenstronger by the very things that would oppose it.

Time and time again when you feared it was goneforever you found that the goodness of life was really only a moment away.Around the next corner, inside every moment, the goodness of life is there tosurprise and delight you.

Take a moment to let the goodness of life touch yourspirit and calm your thoughts. Then, share your good fortune with another. Forthe goodness of life grows more and more magnificent each time it is givenaway.

Though the problems constantly scream for attentionand the conflicts appear to rage ever stronger, the goodness of life growsstronger still, quietly, peacefully, with more purpose and meaning than everbefore.

## 第十五篇：Facing the Enemies Within 直面内在的敌人

Facing the Enemies Within

We are not born with courage, but neither are we bornwith fear. Maybe some of our fears are brought on by your own experiences, bywhat someone has told you, by what you’ve read in the papers. Some fears arevalid, like walking alone in a bad part of town at two o’clock in the morning.But once you learn to avoid that situation, you won’t need to live in fear ofit.

Fears, even the most basic ones, can totally destroyour ambitions. Fear can destroy fortunes. Fear can destroy relationships. Fear,if left unchecked, can destroy our lives. Fear is one of the many enemieslurking inside us.

Let me tell you about five of the other enemies weface from within. The first enemy that you’ve got to destroy before it destroysyou is indifference. What a tragic disease this is! “Ho-hum, let it slide. I’lljust drift along.” Here’s one problem with drifting: you can’t drift your wayto the to of the mountain.

The second enemy we face is indecision. Indecision isthe thief of opportunity and enterprise. It will steal your chances for abetter future. Take a sword to this enemy.

The third enemy inside is doubt. Sure, there’s roomfor healthy skepticism. You can’t believe everything. But you also can’t letdoubt take over. Many people doubt the past, doubt the future, doubt eachother, doubt the government, doubt the possibilities nad doubt theopportunities. Worse of all, they doubt themselves. I’m telling you, doubt willdestroy your life and your chances of success. It will empty both your bankaccount and  your heart. Doubt is anenemy. Go after it. Get rid of it.

The fourth enemy within is worry. We’ve all got toworry some. Just don’t let conquer you. Instead, let it alarm you. Worry can beuseful. If you step off the curb in New  York City and a taxi is coming, you’ve got to worry.But you can’t let worry loose like a mad dog that drives you into a smallcorner. Here’s what you’ve got to do with your worries: drive them into a smallcorner. Whatever is out to get you, you’ve got to get it. Whatever is pushingon you, you’ve got to push back.

The fifth interior enemy is overcaution. It is thetimid approach to life. Timidity is not a virtue; it’s an illness. If you letit go, it’ll conquer you. Timid people don’t get promoted. They don’t advanceand grow and become powerful in the marketplace. You’ve got to avoidovercaution.

Do battle with the enemy. Do battle with your fears.Build your courage to fight what’s holding ou back, what’s keeping you fromyour goals and dreams. Be courageous in your life and in your pursuit of thethings you want and the person you want to become.

## 第十六篇：Abundance is a Life Style 富足的生活方式

Abundance is a Life Style

Abundance is a life style, a way of living your life.It isn’t something you buy now and then or pull down from the cupboard, dustoff and use once or twice, and then return to the cupboard.

Abundance is a philosophy; it appears in yourphysiology, your value system, and carries its own set of beliefs. You walkwith it, sleep with it, bath with it, feel with it, and need to maintain andtake care of it as well.

Abundance doesn’t always require money. Many peoplelive with all that money can buy yet live empty inside. Abundance begins insidewith some main self-ingredients, like love, care, kindness and gentleness,thoughtfulness and compassion. Abundance is a state of being. It radiates outward.It shines like the sun among the many moons in the world.

Being from the brightness of abundance doesn’t allowthe darkness to appear or be in the path unless a choice to allow it to. Thetrue state of abundance doesn’t have room for lies or games normally played.The space is too full of abundance. This may be a challenge because we stillneed to shine for other to see.

Abundance is seeing people for their gifts and notwhat they lack or could be. Seeing all things for their gifts and not what theylack.

Start by knowing what your abundances are, fill thatspace with you, and be fully present from that state of being. Your professionof choice is telling you of knowing and possibilities. That is their gift.Consultants and customer service professionals have the ministrative assistantsand virtual assistants have an abundance of coordination and time management.Abundance is all around you, and all within. See what it is; love yourself forwhat it is, not what you’re missing, or what that can be better, but  for what it is at this present moment.

Be in a state of abundance of what you already have. Iguarantee they are there; it always is buried but there. Breathe them in as ifthey are the air you breathe because they are yours. Let go of anything thatisn’t abundant for the time being. Name the shoe boxes in your closet with yourgifts of abundance; pull from them every morning if needed. Know they arethere.

Learning to trust in your own abundance is required.When you begin to be within your own space of abundance, whatever you need willappear whenever you need it. That’s just the way the higher powers set thisuniverse up to work. Trust the universal energy. The knowing of it all willhumble you to its power yet let the brightness of you shine everywhere it needsto. Just by being from a state of abundance, it is being you.

## 第十七篇：Human Life a Poem 人生如诗

Human Life a Poem

I think that, from a biological standpoint, human lifealmost reads like a poem. It has its own rhythm and beat, its internal cyclesof growth and decay. It begins with innocent childhood, followed by awkwardadolescence trying awkwardly to adapt itself to mature society, with its youngpassions and follies, its ideals and ambitions; then it reaches a manhood ofintense activities, profiting from experience and learning more about societyand human nature; at middle age, there is a slight easing of tension, amellowing of character like the ripening of fruit or the mellowing of goodwine, and the gradual acquiring of a more tolerant, more cynical and at thesame time a kindlier view of life; then In the sunset of our life, theendocrine glands decrease their activity, and if we have a true philosophy ofold age and have ordered our life pattern according to it, it is for us the ageof peace and security and leisure and contentment; finally, life flickers out andone goes into eternal sleep, never to wake up again.

One should be able to sense the beauty of this rhythmof life, to appreciate, as we do in grand symphonies, its main theme, itsstrains of conflict and the final resolution. The movements of these cycles arevery much the same in a normal life, but the music must be provided by theindividual himself. In some souls, the discordant note becomes harsher andharsher and finally overwhelms or submerges the main melody. Sometimes thediscordant note gains so much power that the music can no longer go on, and theindividual shoots himself with a pistol or jump into a river. But that isbecause his original leitmotif has been hopelessly over-showed through the lackof a good self-education. Otherwise the normal human life runs to its normalend in kind of dignified movement and procession. There are sometimes in manyof us too many staccatos or impetuosos, and because the tempo is wrong, themusic is not pleasing to the ear; we might have more of the grand rhythm andmajestic tempo o the Ganges, flowing slowly and eternally into the sea.

No one can say that life with childhood, manhood andold age is not a beautiful arrangement; the day has its morning, noon andsunset, and the year has its seasons, and it is good that it is so. There is nogood or bad in life, except what is good according to its own season. And if wetake this biological view of life and try to live according to the seasons, noone but a conceited fool or an impossible idealist can deny that human life canbe lived like a poem. Shakespeare has expressed this idea more graphically inhis passage about the seven stages of life, and a good many Chinese writershave said about the same thing. It is curious that Shakespeare was never veryreligious, or very much concerned with religion. I think this was hisgreatness; he took human life largely as it was, and intruded himself as littleupon the general scheme of things as he did upon the characters of his plays.Shakespeare was like Nature itself, and that is the greatest compliment we canpay to a writer or thinker. He merely lived, observed life and went away.

## 第十八篇：Solitude 独处

Solitude

I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part ofthe time. To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome anddissipating. I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was socompanionable as solitude. We are for the most part more lonely when we goabroad among men than when we stay in our chambers. A man thinking or workingis always alone, let him be where he will. Solitude is not measured by themiles of space that intervene between a man and his fellows. The reallydiligent student in one of the crowded hives of Cambridge Collegeis as solitary as a dervish in the desert. The farmer can work alone in thefield or the woods all day, hoeing or chopping, and not feel lonesome, becausehe is employed; but when he comes home at night he cannot sit down in a roomalone, at the mercy of his thoughts, but must be where he can :see the folks,:”and recreate, and, as he thinks, remunerate himself for his day’s solitude; andhence he wonders how the student can sit alone in the house all night and mostof the day without ennui and :the blues:; but he does not realize that thestudent, though in the house, is still at work in his field, and chopping inhis woods, as the farmer in his, and in turn seeks the same recreation andsociety that the latter does, though it may be a more condensed form of it.

Society is commonly too cheap. We meet at very shortintervals, not having had time to acquire any new value for each other. We meetat meals three times a day, and give each other a new taste of that old mustycheese that we are. We have had to agree on a certain set of rules, calledetiquette and politeness, to make this frequent meeting tolerable and that weneed not come to open war. We meet at the post-office, and at the sociable, andabout the fireside every night; we live thick and are in each other’s way, andstumble over one another, and I think that we thus lose some respect for oneanother. Certainly less frequency would suffice for all important and heartycommunications. Consider the girls in a factory---never alone, hardly in theirdreams. It would be better if there were but one inhabitant to a square mile,as where I live. The value of a man is not in his skin, that we should touchhim.

I have a great deal of company in my house; especiallyin the morning, when nobody calls. Let me suggest a few comparisons, that someone may convey an idea of my situation. I am no more lonely than the loon inthe pond that laughs so loud, or than Walden Ponditself. What company has that lonely lake, I pray?

And yet it has not the blue devils, but the blueangels in it, in the azure tint of its waters. The sun is alone, except inthick weather, when there sometimes appear to be two, but one is a mock sun.god is alone---but the devil, he is far from being alone; he sees a great dealof company; he is legion. I am no more lonely than a single mullein ordandelion in a pasture, or a bean leaf, or sorrel, or a horse-fly, or abumblebee. I am no more lonely than the Millbrook, or a weathercock, or thenorth star, or the south wind, or an April shower, or a January thaw, or thefirst spider in a new house.

## 第十九篇：Giving Life Meaning 给生命以意义

Giving Life Meaning

Have you thought about what you want people to sayabout you after you’re gone? Can you hear the voice saying, “He was a greatman.” Or “She really will be missed.” What else do they say?

One of the strangest phenomena of life is to engage ina work that will last long after death. Isn’t that a lot like investing allyour money so that future generations can bare interest on it? Perhaps, yet ifyou look deep in your own heart, you’ll find something drives you to make thiskind of contribution---something drives every human being to find a purposethat lives on after death.

Do you hope to memorialize your name? Have a name thatis whispered with reverent awe? Do you hope to have your face carved upon 50 ft of granite rock? Is the answer reallythat simple? Is the purpose of lifetime contribution an ego-driven desire for amortal being to have an immortal name or is it something more?

A child alive today will die tomorrow. A baby that hadthe potential to be the next Einstein will die from complication is at birth.The circumstances of life are not set in stone. We are not all meant to livelife through to old age. We’ve grown to perceive life3 as a full cycle with acertain number of years in between. If all of those years aren’t lived out,it’s a tragedy. A tragedy because a human’s potential was never realized. Atragedy because a spark was snuffed out before it ever became a flame.

By virtue of inhabiting a body we accept these risks.We expose our mortal flesh to the laws of the physical environment around us.The trade off isn’t so bad when you think about it. The problem comes when weconstruct mortal fantasies of what life should be like. When life doesn’tconform to our fantasy we grow upset, frustrated, or depressed.

We are alive; let us live. We have the ability toexperience; let us experience. We have the ability to learn; let us learn. Themeaning of life can be grasped in a moment. A moment so brief it often evadesour perception.

What meaning stands behind the dramatic unfolding oflife? What single truth can we grasp and hang onto for dear life when all othertruths around us seem to fade with time?

These moments are strung together in a series we callevents. These events are strung together in a series we call life. When weseize the moment and bend it according to our will, a will driven by the spiritdeep inside us, then we have discovered the meaning of life, a meaning for usthat shall go on long after we depart this Earth.

## 第二十篇：Relish the Moment 品位现在

Relish the Moment

Tucked away in our subconsciousness is an idyllicvision. We see ourselves on a long trip that spans the moment. We are travelingby train. Out the windows, we drink in the passing scene of cars on nearbyhighways, of children waving at a crossing, of cattle grazing on a distanthillside, of smoke pouring from a power plant, of row upon row of corn adwheat, of flatlands and valleys, of mountains and rolling hillsides, of cityskylines and village halls.

But uppermost in our minds is the final destination.On a certain day at a certain hour, we will pull into the station. Bands willbe playing and flags waving. Once we get there, so many wonderful dreams willcome true and the pieces of our lives will fit together like a completed jigsawpuzzle. How restlessly we pace the aisles, damning the minutes forloitering---waiting, waiting, waiting for the station.

“When we reach the station,that will be it!” we cry. “When I’m 18.” “When I buy a new 450SL MercedesBenz!” “When I put the last kid through college.” “When I have paid off themortgage!” “When I get a promotion.” “When I reach the age of retirement, Ishall live happily ever after!”

Sooner or later, we must realize there is no station,no one place to arrive at once and for all. The true joy of life is the trip.The station is only a dream. It constantly outdistances us.

It isn’t the burdens of today that drive men mad. Itis the regrets over yesterday and the fear of tomorrow. Regret and fear aretwin thieves who rob us of today.

So stop pacing the aisles and counting the miles.Instead, climb more mountains, eat more ice cream, go barefoot more often, swimmore rivers, watch more sunsets, laugh more, cry less. Life must be lived as wego along. The station will come soon enough.

## 第二十一篇：The Love of Beauty 爱美

The Love of Beauty

The love of beauty is an essential part of all healthyhuman nature. It is a moral quality. The absence of it is not an assured groundof condemnation, but the presence of it is an invariable sign of goodness ofheart. In proportion to the degree in which it is felt will probably be thedegree in which nobleness and beauty of character will be attained.

Natural beauty is an all-pervading presence. Theuniverse is its temple. It unfolds into the numberless flowers of spring. Itwaves in the branches of trees and the green blades of grass. It haunts thedepths of the earth and the sea. It gleams from the hues of the shell and theprecious stone. And not only these minute objects but the oceans, themountains, the clouds, the stars, the rising and the setting sun---all overflowwith beauty. This beauty is so precious, and so congenial to our tenderest andnoblest feelings, that it is painful to think of the multitude of people livingin the midst of it and yet remaining almost blind to it.

All persons should seek to become acquainted with thebeauty in nature. There is not a worm we tread upon, nor a leaf that dancesmerrily as it falls before the autumn winds, but calls for our study and admiration.The power to appreciated beauty not merely increases our sources ofhappiness---it enlarges our moral nature, too. Beauty calms our restlessnessand dispels our cares. Go into the fields or the woods, spend a summer day bythe sea or the mountains, and all your little perplexities and anxieties willvanish. Listen to sweet music, and your foolish fears and petty jealousies willpass away. The beauty of the world helps us to seek and find the beauty ofgoodness.

## 第二十二篇：The Happy Door 快乐之门

The Happy door

Happiness is like a pebble dropped into a pool to setin motion an ever-widening circle of ripples. As Stevenson has said, beinghappy is a duty.

There is no exact definition of the word happiness.Happy people are happy for all sorts of reasons. The key is not wealth orphysical well-being, since we find beggars, invalids and so-called failures,who are extremely happy.

Being happy is a sort of unexpected dividend. Butstaying happy is an accomplishment, a triumph of soul and character. It is notselfish to strive for it. It is, indeed, a duty to ourselves and others.

Being unhappy is like an infectious disease. It causespeople to shrink away from the sufferer. He soon finds himself alone, miserableand embittered. There is, however, a cure so simple as to seem, at firstglance, ridiculous; if you don’t feel happy, pretend to be!

It works. Before long you will find that instead ofrepelling people, you attract them. You discover how deeply rewarding it is tobe the center of wider and wider circles of good will.

Then the make-believe becomes a reality. You possessthe secret of peace of mind, and can forget yourself in being of service toothers.

Being happy, once it is realized as a duty andestablished as a habit, opens doors into unimaginable gardens thronged withgrateful friends.

## 第二十三篇：Born to Win 生而为赢

Born to Win

Each human being is born as something new, somethingthat never existed before. Each is born with the capacity to win at life. Eachperson has a unique way of seeing, hearing, touching, tasting and thinking.Each has his or her own unique potentials---capabilities and limitations. Eachcan be a significant, thinking, aware, and creative being---a productiveperson, a winner.

The word “winner” and “loser” have many meanings. Whenwe refer to a person as a winner, we do not mean one who makes someone elselose. To us, a winner is one who responds authentically by being credible,trustworthy, responsive, and genuine, both as an individual and as a member ofa society.

Winners do not dedicated their lives to a concept ofwhat they imagine they should be; rather, they are themselves and as such donot use their energy putting on a performance, maintaining pretence andmanipulating others. They are aware that there is a difference between beingloving and acting loving, between being stupid and acting stupid, between beingknowledgeable and acting knowledgeable. Winners do not need to hide behind amask.

Winners are not afraid to do their own thinking and touse their own knowledge. They can separate facts from opinions and don’tpretend to have all the answers. They listen to others, evaluate what they say,but come to their own conclusions. Although winners can admire and respectother people, they are not totally defined, demolished, bound, or awed by them.

Winners do not play “helpless”, nor do they play theblaming game. Instead, they assume responsibility for their own lives. Theydon’t give others a false authority over them. Winners are their own bosses andknow it.

A winner’s timing is right. Winners respondappropriately to the situation. Their responses are related to the message sentand preserve the significance, worth, well-being, and dignity of the peopleinvolved. Winners know that for everything there is a season and for everyactivity a time.

Although winners can freely enjoy themselves, they canalso postpone enjoyment, can discipline themselves in the present to enhancetheir enjoyment in the future. Winners are not afraid to go after what hewants, but they do so in proper ways. Winners do not get their security bycontrolling others. They do not set themselves up to lose.

A winner cares about the world and its peoples. Awinner is not isolated from the general problems of society, but is concerned,compassionate, and committed to improving the quality of life. Even in the faceof national and international adversity, a winner’s self-image is not one of apowerless individual. A winner works to make the world a better place.

## 第二十四篇：Work and Pleasure 工作和娱乐

Work and Pleasure

To be really happy and really safe, one ought to haveat least two or three hobbies, and they must all be real. It is no use startinglate in life to say: “I will take an interest in this or that.” Such an attemptonly aggravates the strain of mental effort. A man may acquire great knowledgeof topics unconnected with his daily work, and yet hardly get any benefit orrelief. It is no use doing what you like; you have got to like what you do.Broadly speaking, human being may be divided into three classes: those who aretoiled to death, those who are worried to death, and those who are bored todeath. It is no use offering the manual laborer, tired out with a hard week’ssweat and effort, the chance of playing a game of football or baseball onSaturday afternoon. It is no use inviting the politician or the professional orbusiness man, who has been working or worrying about serious things for sixdays, to work or worry about trifling things at the weekend.

It may also be said that rational, industrious, usefulhuman beings are divided into two classes: first, those whose work is work andwhose pleasure is pleasure; and secondly, those whose work and pleasure areone. Of these the former are the majority. They have their compensations. Thelong hours in the office or the factory bring with them as their reward, notonly the means of sustenance, but a keen appetite for pleasure even in itssimplest and most modest forms. But Fortune’s favored children belong to thesecond class. Their life is a natural harmony. For them the working hours arenever long enough. Each day is a holiday, and ordinary holidays when they comeare grudged as enforced interruptions in an absorbing vacation. Yet to bothclasses the need of an alternative outlook, of a change of atmosphere, of adiversion of effort, is essential. Indeed, it may well be that those whose workis their pleasure are those who most need the means of banishing it atintervals from their minds.

## 第二十五篇：Mirror, Mirror--What do I see镜子,镜子,告诉我

Mirror, Mirror---What do I See?

A loving person lives in a loving world. A hostileperson lives in a hostile world. Everyone you meet is your mirror.

Mirrors have a very particular function. They reflectthe image in front of them. Just as a physical mirror serves as the vehicle toreflection, so do all of the people in our lives.

When we see something beautiful such as a flowergarden, that garden serves as a reflection. In order to see the beauty in frontof us, we must be able to see the beauty inside of ourselves. When we lovesomeone, it’s a reflection of loving ourselves. When we love someone, it’s areflection of loving ourselves. We have often heard things like “I love how Iam when I’m with that person.” That simply translates into “I’m able to love mewhen I love that other person.” Oftentimes, when we meet someone new, we feelas though we “click”. Sometimes it’s as if we’ve known each other for a longtime. That feeling can come from sharing similarities.

Just as the “mirror” or other person can be a positivereflection, it is more likely that we’ll notice it when it has a negativeconnotation. For example, it’s easy to remember times when we have met someonewe’re not particularly crazy about. We may have some criticism in our mindabout the person. This is especially true when we get to know someone with whomwe would rather spend less time.

Frequently, when we dislike qualities in other people,ironically, it’s usually the mirror that’s speaking to us.

I began questioning myself further each time Iencountered someone that I didn’t particularly like. Each time, I asked myself,“What is it about that person that I don’t like?” and then “Is there somethingsimilar in me?” in every instance, I could see a piece of that quality in me,and sometimes I had to really get very introspective. So what did that mean?

It means that just as I can get annoyed or disturbedwhen I notice that aspect in someone else, I better reexamine my qualities andconsider making some changes. Even if I’m not willing to make a drastic change,at least I consider how I might modify some of the things that I’m doing.

At times we meet someone new and feel distant,disconnected, or disgusted. Although we don’t want to believe it, and it’s noteasy or desirable to look further, it can be a great learning lesson to figureout what part of the person is being reflected in you. It’s simply just anotherway to create more self-awareness.

## 第二十六篇：On Motes and Beams 微尘与栋梁

On Motes and Beams

It is curious that our own offenses should seem somuch less heinous than the offenses of others. I suppose the reason is that weknow all the circumstances that have occasioned them and so manage to excuse inourselves what we cannot excuse in others. We turn our attention away from ourown defects, and when we are forced by untoward events to consider them, findit easy to condone them. For all I know we are right to do this; they are partof us and we must accept the good and bad in ourselves together.

But when we come to judge others, it is not byourselves as we really are that we judge them, but by an image that we haveformed of ourselves fro which we have left out everything that offends ourvanity or would discredit us in the eyes of the world. To take a trivialinstance: how scornful we are when we catch someone out telling a lie; but whocan say that he has never told not one, but a hundred?

There is not much to choose between men. They are alla hotchpotch of greatness and littleness, of virtue and vice, of nobility andbaseness. Some have more strength of character, or more opportunity, and so inone direction or another give their instincts freer play, but potentially theyare the same. For my part, I do not think I am any better or any worse thanmost people, but I know that if I set down every action in my life and everythought that has crossed my mind, the world would consider me a monster ofdepravity. The knowledge that these reveries are common to all men shouldinspire one with tolerance to oneself as well as to others. It is well also ifthey enable us to look upon our fellows, even the most eminent and respectable,with humor, and if they lead us to take ourselves not too seriously.

## 第二十七篇：An October Sunrise 十月的日出

An October Sunrise

I was up the next morning be fore the October sunrise,and away through the wild and the woodland. The rising of the sun was noble inthe cold and warmth of it peeping down the spread of light, he raised hisshoulder heavily over the edge of grey mountain and wavering length of upland.Beneath his gaze the dew-fogs dipped, and crept to crept to the hollow places;then stole away in line and column, holding skirts, and clinging subtly at thesheltering corners where rock hung over grassland, while the brave lines of thehills came forth, one beyond other gliding.

The woods arose in folds, like drapery of awakenedmountains, stately with a depth of awe, and memory of the tempests. Autumn’smellow hand was upon them, as they owned already, touched with gold and red andolive, and their joy towards the sun was less to a bridegroom than a father.

Yet before the floating impress of the woods couldclear it self, suddenly the gladsome light leaped over hill and valley, castingamber, blue, and purple, and a tint of rich red rose; according to the scenethey lit on, and the curtain flung around; yet all alike dispelling fear andthe cloven hoof of darkness, all on the wings of hope advancing, andproclaiming, “God is here!” then life and joy sprang reassured from everycrouching hollow; every flower, and bud and bird had a fluttering sense ofthem; and all the flashing of God’s gaze merged into soft beneficence.

So, perhaps, shall break upon us that eternal morning,when crag and chasm shall be no more, neither hill and valley, nor greatunvintaged ocean; but all things shall arise, and shine in the light of theFather’s countenance, because itself is risen.

## 第二十八篇：To Be or Not to Be 生存还是毁灭

To be or not to be

Outside the Bible, these six words are the most famousin all the literature of the world. They were spoken by Hamlet when he wasthinking aloud, and they are the most famous words in Shakespeare becauseHamlet was speaking not only for himself but also for every thinking man andwoman. To be or not to be, to live or not to live, to live richly andabundantly and eagerly, or to live dully and meanly and scarcely. A philosopheronce wanted to know whether he was alive or not, which is a good question foreveryone to put to himself occasionally. He answered it by saying: "I think,therefore am."

But the best definition of existence ever saw didanother philosopher who said: "To be is to be in relations." If thistrue, then the more relations a living thing has, the more it is alive. To liveabundantly means simply to increase the range and intensity of our relations.Unfortunately we are so constituted that we get to love our routine. But apartfrom our regular occupation how much are we alive? If you are interest-ed onlyin your regular occupation, you are alive only to that extent. So far as otherthings are concerned--poetry and prose, music, pictures, sports, unselfishfriendships, politics, international affairs--you are dead.

Contrariwise, it is true that every time you acquire anew interest--even more, a new accomplishment--you increase your power of life.No one who is deeply interested in a large variety of subjects can remain unhappy;the real pessimist is the person who has lost interest.

Bacon said that a man dies as often as he loses afriend. But we gain new life by contacts, new friends. What is supremely trueof living objects is only less true of ideas, which are also alive. Where yourthoughts are, there will your live be also. If your thoughts are confined onlyto your business, only to your physical welfare, only to the narrow circle ofthe town in which you live, then you live in a narrow cir-conscribed life. Butif you are interested in what is going on in China, then you are living inChina~ if you’re interested in the characters of a good novel, then you areliving with those highly interesting people, if you listen intently to finemusic, you are away from your immediate surroundings and living in a world ofpassion and imagination.

To be or not to be--to live intensely and richly,merely to exist, that depends on ourselves. Let widen and intensify ourrelations. While we live, let live!

## 第二十九篇：Gettysburg Address 葛底斯堡演说

GettysburgAddress

Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers broughtforth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated tothe proposition that all men are created equal.

Now, we are engaged in a great civil war, testingwhether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can longendure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicatea portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave theirlives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that weshould do this.

But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannotconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, whostruggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can neverforget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicatedhere to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so noblyadvanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remainingbefore us---that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to thatcause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we herehighly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation,under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that government of thepeople, by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

## 第三十篇：First Inaugural Address(Excerpts) 就职演讲（节选）

First Inaugural Address

We observe today not a victory of party, but acelebration of freedom, symbolizing an end, as well as a beginning; signifyingrenewal, as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God thesame solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quartersago.

in your hands, my fellow citizens, more than in mine,will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this country wasfounded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony toits national loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call toservice surround the globe.

Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call tobear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled weare; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in andyear out, “rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation”,a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, andwar itself.

Can we forge against these enemies a grand and globalalliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful lifefor all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?

In the long history of the world, only a fewgenerations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour ofmaximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility. I welcome it. I donot believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or anyother generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to thisendeavor will light our country and all who serve it. And the glow from thatfire can truly light the world.

And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your countrycan do for you, ask what you can do for your country.

My fellow citizens of the world, ask not what Americawill do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.

Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, askof us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask ofyou. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judgeof our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing andHis help, but knowing that here on earth, God’s work must truly be our own.
