# The Alchemist

by Paulo Coelho

We look around at all those who have failed to get what they want and feel that we do not deserve to get what we want either.

Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.

“It’s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what’s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That’s the world’s greatest lie.”

“If you start out by promising what you don’t even have yet, you’ll lose your desire to work toward getting it.”
