## Chapter 3

Do not cast yourself against such a rock -- he will break you like glass

## Chapter 4

To be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward.

## Chapter 5

"Why, I am going to fight -- because I am going to fight," answered Porthos, blushing.

This short interval was sufficient to decide d'Artagnan on the part he was to take. It was one of those events that determine the course of a man's life; it was a choice between the king and the cardinal, a choice which once made, must be persisted in. To fight was to disobey the law, risk his head, make an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself. All this the young man understood, and yet -- to his praise be it said -- he did not hesitate a second.

Turning to Athos and his friends, he said, "Gentlemen, allow me to correct your words, if you please. You said you were but three, but it seems to me we are four."

## Chapter 6

A judge must hear both sides.

An edict is still an edict.

## Chapter 7

Like master like man.

Aramis:"As for myself, I never have, nor desire to have, a mistress."

D'Artagnan:"The future cannot fail to mend. Better times will certainly come and that means your fortune is made if you remain with me. I am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by allowing you to leave."

## Chapter 8

Four such men must inevitably, surreptitiously or openly, by cunning or by force, clear a way toward the goal they wished to reach, however well it might be defended or however distant it might seem.

## Chapter 9

Woman was created for our destruction, and all our miseries come from her. — Aramis

all for one, one for all — that is our motto, is it not? (D'Artagnan)

## Chapter 10

When an individual suspected of any crime is arrested in a particular house, the arrest is kept secret and four or five men are stationed in the first room of the house. The door is opened to all who knock, then closed behind them and they are arrested; that way, at the end of two or three days the police have in their hands almost everyone who regularly goes there. And this is a mousetrap. （守株待兔）

Have you any friend whose clock is too slow? （制造不在场证据）

## Chapter 11

The most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she has.

... do not make an ugly woman pretty, but they make a pretty woman beautiful. （打扮）

Love is the most selfish of all the passions.

We must never expect discretion in first love: it is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy is allowed to overflow, it will chock you.

That is because love has come to me very suddenly, and for the first time, and because I am not even twenty. (D'Artagnan)

What is lost for today may not be lost forever. (Bonacieux)

But be of good cheer -- all things come to certain people. (Bonacieux)

## Chapter 12

> “It is now three years, madame, since I saw you for the first time, and during those three years I have loved you thus. Shall I tell you how you were dressed the first time I saw you? Shall I describe to you each ornament of your toilet? Mark! I see you now. You were seated upon cushions in the Spanish fashion; you wore a robe of green satin embroidered with gold and silver, hanging sleeves knotted upon your beautiful arms—those lovely arms—with large diamonds. You wore a close ruff, a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe, and in that cap a heron’s feather. Hold, hold! I shut my eyes, and I can see you as you then were; I open them again, and I see what you are now—a hundred times more beautiful!”
>
> “What folly,” murmured Anne of Austria, who had not the courage to find fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his heart, “what folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances!”
>
> “And upon what then must I live? I have nothing but memory. It is my happiness, my treasure, my hope. Every time I see you is a fresh diamond which I enclose in the casket of my heart. This is the fourth which you have let fall and I have picked up; for in three years, madame, I have only seen you four times—the first, which I have just described to you; the second, at the mansion of Madame de Chevreuse; the third, in the gardens of Amiens.”
>
> “Duke,” said the queen, blushing, “never speak of that evening.”
>
> “Oh, let us speak of it; on the contrary, let us speak of it! That is the most happy and brilliant evening of my life! You remember what a beautiful night it was? How soft and perfumed was the air; how lovely the blue heavens and star-enameled sky! Ah, then, madame, I was able for one instant to be alone with you. Then you were about to tell me all—the isolation of your life, the griefs of your heart. You leaned upon my arm—upon this, madame! I felt, in bending my head toward you, your beautiful hair touch my cheek; and every time that it touched me I trembled from head to foot. Oh, Queen, Queen! you do not know what felicity from heaven, what joys from paradise, are comprised in a moment like that. Take my wealth, my fortune, my glory, all the days I have to live, for such an instant, for a night like that. For that night, madame, that night you loved me, I will swear it.”

If I am happy in an error, do not have the cruelty to correct it. (Buckingham)

But the words you have just spoken, the hope you have almost given me, will have been worth everything -- even my life. (Buckingham)
